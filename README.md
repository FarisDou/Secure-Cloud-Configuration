Click on Recommendations. 
Ideally we want to get to 100%.

Currently, I am at 54%. So go through each, apply each remediation steps according to Azure and get your score up. 

I will start with the DDos Protection and I wont show everything. However, take your time with this and Azure redirects you to everything.

Well, this series of projects in Microsoft Azure is finally at its conclusion.

Over time there will be updates and cleaning up. 

However, whoever is viewing this. 

I hope  you learned a lot because I have learned a lot. 

Thank you.
